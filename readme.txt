= How does it work? =

After you upload an image to your WordPress site, each resized image is uploaded to the TinyJPG or TinyPNG service. Your image is analyzed to apply the best possible optimization. Based on the content of your image an optimal strategy is chosen. The result is sent back to your WordPress site and will replace the original image with one smaller in size. On average JPEG images are compressed by 40-60% and PNG images by 50-80% without visible loss in quality. Your website will load faster for your visitors, and youâ€™ll save storage space and bandwidth!

= Getting started =

Install this plugin and follow the instructions to set up your account. With a regular WordPress installation you can optimize **roughly 100 images each month** for free. The exact total depends on the number of thumbnail sizes that are in use in your WordPress installation. You can change which of the generated thumbnail sizes should be optimized on the *Settings > TinyPNG* page. Once installed you can also switch to a [paid account](https://tinypng.com/dashboard/api) which removes the limits and allows you to optimize as many images as you like.

= Optimizing all your images =

You can *bulk optimize* your existing JPEG, PNG, and WebP images all at once by going to *Media > Bulk TinyPNG*. Clicking on the big button will start optimizing all unoptimized images in your media library.

= Multisite support =

The plugin is fully multisite compatible and you can set the API key for all sites by defining the key in your *wp-config.php* file. View the installation instructions for more information.

= From WordPress.org =

1. Download the plugin named 'TinyPNG - JPEG, PNG & WebP image compression' by 'TinyPNG'.

Once set up you will see a message on the *Settings > TinyPNG* page. This will work for normal and multisite WordPress installations.

== Screenshots ==

1. Register a new account or enter your existing API key. Then choose the image sizes to optimize and any other options like resizing and preserving metadata in your original image uploads.
2. In the Media Library list view you can see the savings on your images.
3. From the Media Library you can compress individual images and use the Bulk Actions drop-down to quickly optimize multiple images at once.
4. Last but not least you can also use Bulk TinyPNG to optimize your entire WordPress site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q: How many images can I optimize for free? =
A: In a default WordPress installation you can optimize around 100 images for free each month. WordPress creates different thumbnails of your images which all have to be compressed. Some plugins even add more sizes, so take a look at the *Settings > TinyPNG - JPEG, PNG & WebP image compression* page before you start optimization.

= Q: How can I remove the 500 limit? =
A: Just add your *Payment details* on your [account dashboard](https://tinypng.com/dashboard/api) to remove the limit. For a small fee the additional compressions above 500 will then be charged to your account at the end of each month.

= Q: What happens to the optimized images when I uninstall the plugin? =
A: When you remove the plugin all your optimized images will remain optimized.

= Q: I don't recall uploading 500 photos this month but my limit is already reached. How is this number calculated? =
A: When you upload an image to your website, WordPress will create different sized versions of it (see *Settings > TinyPNG*). The plugin will compress each of these sizes, so when you have 100 images and 5 different sizes you will do 500 compressions.

= Q: Is there a file size limit? =
A: Yes, but they are **very** generous! The maximum file size is 500MB and the maximum canvas size is 256MP (16000px by 16000px in any ratio).

= Q: Can I use the same API key on all my websites? =
A: Yes, there are no limitations. You can add the same key everywhere.

= Q: Can I hide my API key from the admin? =
A: Yes, you can hide your API key from the admin so other admin users will not be able to see it. To do this you should define the API key in your *wp-config.php* file. See the installation instructions for more information.

= Q: What happens when I reach my monthly limit? =
A: Everything will keep on working, but newly uploaded images will not be optimized. Of course we encourage everyone to [switch](https://tinypng.com/dashboard/api) to a paid account to cover the hosting and development costs of the service.

= Q: Can I optimize all existing images in my media library? =
A: Yes! After installing the plugin, go to *Media > Bulk TinyPNG*, and click on the start button to optimize all unoptimized images in your media library.

= Q: How do I switch to a paid account? =
A: You can upgrade to a paid account by adding your *Payment details* on your [account dashboard](https://tinypng.com/dashboard/api). Additional compressions above 500 will then be charged at the end of each month as a one-time fee.
